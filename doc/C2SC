How to set up CtoSC Compiler

1.
 cd src/c2scpp

2.
 ./configure && make

3. Add
    (%cinclude "<stdio.h>" (:macro))
   into your SC code to include declarations in <stdio.h>.

4. To include C macros, set the :macro keyword argument as
    (%cinclude "<stdio.h>" (:macro NULL stdin stdout)).

5. To include multiple C header files, write as
    (%cinclude "<stdio.h>" "<math.h>" (:macro NULL stdin stdout)).
